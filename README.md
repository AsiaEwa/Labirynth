# Labirynth
finding the shortest path, optimization, game
C++
The program allows you to follow the search progress step by step. In what order are the nodes searched, how do the most important parameters change, so that it is possible to check whether the algorithm actually works correctly.
A program that finds a path in a maze from the entrance to the exit using:
* depth-first search (DFS) algorithm,
* breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm 
* A* (A-star) algorithm
